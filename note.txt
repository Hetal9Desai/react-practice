what is hooks?
hooks are a new feature addition in reactthat allow you to use React features without having to write class.
eg. State of a component 
-hooks dont waork inside classes

Why Hooks?
1)understand how this keyword works in javascript
remember to bind event handlers in class components
classes don't minify very well and make hot reloading very unreliable
Hot reloading means updating your app without a full page refresh â€” super helpful during development.

2) there is no particular way to reuse stateful component logic
Hoc and render props patterns do address this problem
makes the code harder to follow
there is need a to share stateful logic in a better way

3)create components for complex scnerio such as data fetching and subscribing to events Related code is not organized in one place
eg. Data fetching - In componentDidMount and componentDidUpadate
eg. Evevnt listenters - In componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
because of stateful logic - cann't break into smaller ones 

inshort 1)avoid the whole confusion with 'this' keyword
2) allow you to reuse stateful logic
3) organize the component inside a component into reusable isolated units
